summary = "A global land-based gridded dataset of daily precipitation at 1 degree X 1 degree resolution from 1950 to 2013. Two datasets are available under the REGEN moniker. One interpolates all daily precipitation stations available regardless of completeness of station timeseries (available [here](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/rainfall-estimates-gridded-station-v10/1340689)). A second related dataset interpolates only the long-term stations (stations with at least 40 complete years of data) (available [here](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/rainfall-estimates-gridded-station-v10/1340690)). Besides the grid cell average precipitation amount per day (mm/day), the Yamamoto standard deviation per grid cell (mm/day), the kriging error per grid cell (%) and number of stations per grid cell variables are also included. For detailed documentation, refer to the [journal article](https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/hess-2018-595/)."
