# Biography

Steefan is interested in gaining crucial insights from data (such as climate system observations or projections) by using novel statistical and numerical analysis techniques. He is also interested in effectively communicating these insights using simple data visualisations (check out [isithotrightnow.com](https://isithotrightnow.com)).

During his Phd, Steefan has gained a comprehensive understanding of the complex changes in global rainfall by applying a novel statistical technique that reveals changes in all intensities of rainfall using a brand new dataset of rainfall that he developed by harmonisation, homogenisation, quality control and interpolation of large global data archives. This state of the art dataset is enabling cutting-edge research around the globe. He is now applying his skillset to understand the complex relationships between physical and biological ocean observations in the coastal oceanography group at UNSW Sydney. 

Based on his background in experimental quantum computing, he is also interested in algorithms that take advantage of quantum computers to overcome computational constraints on complex analysis of large datasets.
