I have applied for [The Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/application_status.html) Fellowship program, a highly competitive fellowship aimed at bringing researchers with exceptional data analysis and statistical talent into industry. During the process I have been asked to update my resume based on some very helpful tips. I wish to share this advice with any fellow researchers interested in applying for industry data science positions. Note that I do NOT own any of the following information and The Data Incubator is completely within its rights to request me to take this post down, should they desire. 

>...you will not be judged by the sum total of what you have accomplished, but rather by the average of what you present. So your strategy should only be to present the best things (as judged by your audience) and cut out anything else. The other stuff only detracts.

>1. **Resumes should be single-page**. Two page resumes do not fare nearly as well in front of hiring managers. More often than not, hiring managers will scan for highlights and disregard the second page if you've included it or throw out all resumes with 2 pages.
2. **Do not use less than 11-pt font**. Do not use a small margin. See above.
3. **List at most one to two papers**. If you have written more, say "Wrote 10 published papers, including."Unless your paper was in a top journal in a recognized field (e.g. American Economic Review, Phys. Rev. Lett, Cell, Nature, New England Journal of Medicine, etc.) consider not listing it if you have more valuable information to present.
4. **Emphasize the computational / data / mathematical / statistical aspects of your work**. At most 6 lines total spread out across at most 3 projects or jobs. These can be academic, industry, or “for fun” projects. You should approach these with these guidelines in mind:
	<ol type="a">
 	<li> <b>Emphasize computational / data / mathematical / statistical aspects</b>. If you spent 24 months collecting data in a lab and 2 weeks analyzing it, talk about those 2 weeks. You are not being hired as a lab rat.</li>
	<li> <b>Give a specific metric you improved (i.e. give a number)</b>. People are hiring you to be quantitative, not qualitative, and businesses care about measurable results that you can deliver.<ul>	<li> <b>Bad:</b> "Improved model performance" (What does 'improved' mean? How much better is the model?) </li>
		<li> <b>Good:</b> "My model lowered RMSE by 20% compared to the state of the art" (I know what your metric was and how much better you are according to that metric.)</li>
		<li> <b>Good:</b> "My software reduced our codebase size by 30% and ran in half the time".</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li> <b>Short problem domain statements (3-5 words)</b>. You're not being hired to be a weak analyst.</li>
		<ul><li> E.g. "Studied galaxy formation and clustering"</li>
		<li> E.g. "Analyzed mice cell division"</li></ul>
	<li><b>Emphasize size of data:</b></li>
	<ul><li>E.g. "Analyzed 50GB of sensor data"</li>
		<li>E.g. "Analyzed 5 million galaxies"</li></ul>
	<li><b>Make it clear what kind of technical problem you're solving</b>. E.g., ETL, regression, classification, recommender system, unsupervised, etc.</li>
	<li><b>Emphasize leadership / group work if possible</b>. E.g. "Led a group," "organized a colloquia," etc.</li>
	<li><b>Mention a few tools / statistical or mathematical techniques</b>. E.g. K-Means clustering, logistic regression, etc.</li>
	<li><b>Don't just say something, show it:</b></li>
	<ul><li><b>Bad:</b> "I have great leadership skills" (Says who?)</li>
		<li><b>Good:</b> "Led a team of 40 researchers to develop a new $30M propulsion system being used in NASA's PlutoX satellite." (Not only did you lead a group, you did so successfully.)</li></ul>
	<li><b>Stick to objective facts, not subjective descriptors</b>. Even better, explain why what you did is better:</li>
	<ul><li><b>Bad:</b> "I wrote a fast algorithm to analyze a lot of data" is subjective (I might think it's a slow algorithm on a small dataset).</li>
		<li><b>Better:</b> "I sped up our analysis algorithm by 20x" is objective (there are now no weasel words but I am still skeptical -- how did you do it?).</li>
		<li><b>Best:</b> "By caching the most frequently used 1% of the data, I sped up our analysis algorithm by 20x" is objective and believable: caching is a common way to make algorithms faster.</li></ul>
	</ol>
5. **As an example:** "Led group of 4 graduate students to improve energy demand forecasting, analyzed 50GB of data, lowering RMS error by 20% by using a distributed ARIMA model training code (Java).”
6. **Fun facts about yourself are great!** They make a great concluding sentence ("I've traveled to 40 countries," "I'm a martial arts black belt," etc.)
7. **Don't list GPAs lower than 3.8**. In general, you don't need to list a GPA at all.
8. **Don't list common office software:** e.g. Microsoft Word, Excel.
9. **Formatting is important**. Please find a professional-looking format for your resume by searching for one.

Based on the above information I have updated my resume as follows. You can compare this updated resume with my full research CV [here](https://steefancontractor.github.io/pdf/SteefanContractor_CV.pdf).
